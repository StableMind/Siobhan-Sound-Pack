## A Sound Pack For Open TX 2.2 Featuring the Lovely Voice of Siobhan.

The Siobhan Sound Pack contains all the Sounds we think you will need for a full flying experience. 

The [zip](SSP.zip) (Click on Download next to History) above contains all the files but we will be putting then in a small, medium and full sized pack format soon. You can pick individual files from the [en](en/) and [SYSTEM](en/SYSTEM) folders to suit your needs (Right Click,Save Link As..). 

Just have a look at the [file list](SSP_FileList.csv) above and choose the files you want.

We hope you enjoy The Siobhan Sound Pack and if you find any bugs or errors please let us know. ~~There are a few files missing but we will get those recorded and up soon.~~ This has only been tested on the FrSky Qx7 at the moment so if you could try on other devices and give us some feedback that would help. We are working on an easy way to select and download files and hope to bring you that soon. There are a few duplicated file but the file names are different as we are still tring to work out the file structure.
